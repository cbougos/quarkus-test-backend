# quarkus-test Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in minikube kubernetes cluster

You can run your application in a minikube kubernetes cluster using:

```shell script
#Start the master node
minikube start --driver docker
#Apply the cluster configuration
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
#Expose the backend service to localhost
minikube service quarkus-backend-service
```

## Running the application in fully dockerized mode

You can run your application in a local docker network:

```shell script
docker-compose -p quarkus-test -f src/main/docker/docker-compose/<docker-compose-file> up --build
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./gradlew build
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/quarkus-test-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling.
